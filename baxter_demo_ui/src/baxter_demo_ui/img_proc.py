'''~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# PIL/cv interaction
# The functions in this secion handle interactions between
#   PIL and cvmat formats.
# **gen_msg() converts an RGB PIL image to a BGR cvmat image
# **rgb_to_bgr() converts an RGB PIL image to a BGR PIL image
# **PIL_to_cv() converts a BGR PIL image to a cvmat image
# **cv_to_msg() converts a cvmat image to a rosmsg format
# **msg_to_cv() converts a rosmsg image to a cvmat image
# **overlay() takes an original image, the size of that image,
#    a rectangle defined in that original image, and a new
#    new image and returns the original image with the new
#    image overlayed in the defined rectangle.
#    For the moment, this is mainly used for the Camera
#       Display demo, overlaying the selected camera's image
#       onto the UI display
